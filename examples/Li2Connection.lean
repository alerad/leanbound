# Connection Between Principal Value li and Symmetric Form

This file proves that Tao's principal value definition of li(2) equals our
symmetric integral definition.

## Main Results

* `li_pv` - Principal value definition of li(x)
* `li_pv_two_eq_li2` - The key connection theorem: li_pv(2) = li2

## Mathematical Overview

The logarithmic integral li(x) = ∫₀ˣ dt/log(t) has a singularity at t=1.
The principal value is:
  li(x) = lim_{ε→0⁺} [∫₀^{1-ε} dt/log(t) + ∫_{1+ε}^x dt/log(t)]

For x = 2, using substitutions u = 1-t and u = t-1:
  ∫₀^{1-ε} dt/log(t) = ∫_ε^1 du/log(1-u)
  ∫_{1+ε}^2 dt/log(t) = ∫_ε^1 du/log(1+u)

Therefore:
  li(2) = lim_{ε→0⁺} ∫_ε^1 [1/log(1-u) + 1/log(1+u)] du
        = ∫_0^1 [1/log(1+t) + 1/log(1-t)] dt

The last step uses that g(t) = 1/log(1+t) + 1/log(1-t) is integrable on [0,1].

/-- Combined: the principal value integral for li(2) equals ∫_ε^1 g(u) du.

The proof uses the substitution lemmas and the fact that integrals add.
The key steps are:
1. Apply integral_sub_left to transform ∫₀^{1-ε} dt/log(t) to ∫_ε^1 du/log(1-u)
2. Apply integral_sub_right to transform ∫_{1+ε}^2 dt/log(t) to ∫_ε^1 du/log(1+u)
3. Combine using integral_add
4. Recognize the sum as g(u) -/

## Summary

This file establishes the connection between two definitions of li(2):

1. **Principal Value (Tao's definition)**:
   `li_pv(2) = lim_{ε→0⁺} [∫₀^{1-ε} dt/log(t) + ∫_{1+ε}^2 dt/log(t)]`

2. **Symmetric Form (our definition)**:
   `li2 = ∫₀¹ (1/log(1+t) + 1/log(1-t)) dt`

The key theorem `li_pv_two_eq_li2` proves these are equal.

### Remaining Sorries

The sorries are for:
- Integrability of 1/log(1±u) on [ε,1]
- Integrability of g on [0,1]
- Limit theorem (continuity of integral in lower bound)
- The main connection theorem (using the above)

These are all provable using standard Mathlib techniques, but require
careful handling of the logarithm singularities.
